A first repository, learning how to use GitHub

Hi, 

My name is Mandy and I'm currently undergoing a huge career shift. 
I'm finishing my bachelor's degree in Music Performance, but I'm realizing that I want to do something different with my life. 
So I'm learning coding and web development. 
Getting started on GitHub is one of many steps I'm taking in this direction.
